# Laptops Price Prediction
My first Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This machine learning project focuses on predicting laptop prices using a regression model, based on various features such as CPU, brand, storage type, and other specifications. 
The model utilizes linear regression to estimate final prices and assess the impact of different features, helping consumers and retailers make informed pricing decisions.

#### Linear regression, data splitting and scaling, and feature encoding, were all implemented manually, from scratch, without the use of scikit-learn.

## Libraries used : 
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles categorical variables using one-hot encoding, scales numerical features, and splits the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
- **Model Training**: Implements a linear regression model to predict laptop prices.
- **Evaluation**: Uses RMSE to evaluate model performance across different seeds.

## Dataset
- The dataset used for training the model includes various laptop specifications and their final prices.
- The dataset is in CSV format and downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/juanmerinobermejo/laptops-price-dataset)
